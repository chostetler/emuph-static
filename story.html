    <p>While piecing together some of the artifacts, your team has noticed that the answers to the cryptic 
        puzzles form a map of the great Ring of Fire! But the location of the treasure is still a mystery. Can
       you piece together the answers to find the treasure?</p>

<div class="no-break story-chunk">
    <p>Long before Eastern Mennonite University was built in the Shenandoah Valley, our valley was simply not a valley at all, 
        but a bustling island. Emu Island, named after its unique main animal species, was rumored to be the epicenter of the 
        Shenandoah Sea. It was lined with ports and covered with shops on its shore. The Emu pirates took great care of the island, 
        ensuring the beaches stayed clean and the dense tropical forests were healthy.</p>
    <p>Although historians were puzzled with the sudden disappearance of the Shenandoah Sea and the inhabitants of Emu island, 
        they found scrolls and books covered with cryptic pictures and markings. The Emu pirates live on through landmarks and 
        artifacts still around today, but there has been some recent speculation about the coincidental nature of these remains.</p>
    <p>Rumor has it that the Emu pirates left Emu island willingly after the Shenandoah Sea dried up, but left treasure for future 
        generations to discover. Upon further digging, historians have confirmed these suspicions - the artifacts left 
        behind seem to point to a treasure.</p>
    <p>Can you solve their cryptic puzzles, and be the first to find their <b>long lost treasure</b>?</p>
