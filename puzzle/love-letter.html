<div class="letter"><p>    Greetings my dearest Sashoya,</p><p>    I long to hear your beautiful voice again. I miss you like no other, and I yen for the day when we may raise our Voices Together in song once more. Your name is the key to my heart, and I yearn for my heart to be open once more. O love that will not let me go, hold tight to me, so that I may see you again someday. </p><p>    There shall be joy to the world (at least, to my world) when we are reunited once again. I feel most excited to share with you my new practice. It is a new sort of social movement called square dancing! It is most enjoyable, and I am overflowing with anticipation to some day show you this newest innovation. I danced with a lovely gal named Polly B. Yuss but know that in the square of my heart, your name is before any other. With this sentiment, I've created a new square dance to honor you, my love.</p><p>    It pains me to be apart from you for so long, but when we must bear persistent pain, we must stay strong. I know that soon we will be reunited again. Dearest, I promise this shall be my last seafaring adventure. I am ready to settle down and build our cabin by the lake. </p><p>    When love is found, it cannot be taken for granted. I know these voyages of mine have been even more difficult on you than they have been on me, so I promise you that this will be my final voyage. After this, we can begin our family and live a long, happy life together. We will show our children all of our favorite things, like square dancing. There is no doubt in my mind that this is what I want. </p><p>    I will see you again soon, my love. I know it is difficult to be apart. But, we must remember: joyful is the dark, for the light that comes shall be all the greater for it. </p><p>    Till next we meet, my love. </p><p>    Your Dearest, </p><p><b>John Thyme</b></p><p>    P.S. </p><p>    Behind the curtain of music great, the books to solve my riddle wait. <br>Scour the pages and crack the code, then return the book to its abode. </p></div>
