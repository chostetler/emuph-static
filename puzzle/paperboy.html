<div class="route-page"><h3>Your Route</h3><ol><li>Begin at the starting house. Does it smell like rotten eggs to you too? Or is that just me? </li><li>Head directly south and cross the river. You will get pushed to the west, but make sure to land on the nearest prime-numbered house less than 70.</li><li>Go directly back across the river, then head west some number of blocks, and north one block to a single-letter house.</li><li>Go south and cross the river again. I don't know where it is, but you need to go to the only single-letter house on this side of the river. It should be glowing.</li><li>Depart the glowing house and return to the one you started at, the eggy one. They want a second paper. (Sorry)</li><li>Head west by south west. Your map should show that this house is directly north of a port that leads to the river, but some other maps won't show this.</li><li>Head back the way you came and go to a house that directly borders the egg-smelling house. The air from the west and the coast to the north should help to mask the fumes of the houses to the south and southwest.</li><li>Remember that glowing house across the river? You have another delivery there.</li><li>Your next paper delivery is a 3-digit house... but all of the digits are the same! Crazy!</li><li>Head west along the river and then north to the next house on your list. The man there will tell you that his weight is 186.207 pounds. Don't ask me how I know. </li><li>Head directly east and stop at the last house before you reach the Noble District.</li><li>Your last delivery of the day is one block north, and one block west.</li><li>You can return back across the river to your American home. That's all for today! Maybe you can hang out with your European neighbors later. </li></ol></div>
